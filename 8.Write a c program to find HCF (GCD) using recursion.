Problem No : 08
Problem Name : Write a c program to find HCF (GCD) using recursion.
Sample Input/Output : 
                              Input	                           Output
                          12 and 30	                 GCD of 12 and 30 = 6                   
                            6 and 8	                    GCD of 6 and 8 = 2      

Coding : 

#include<stdio.h>
int gcd(int a, int b)
{
    if(b == 0)
        return a;
    else
        return gcd(b, a%b);
}
int main()
{
    int num1, num2, hcf;

    /* Input two numbers from user */
    printf("Enter any two numbers to find GCD: ");
    scanf("%d%d", &num1, &num2);

    hcf = gcd(num1, num2);

    printf("GCD of %d and %d = %d", num1, num2, hcf);

    return 0;
}

Result and Discussion : From  the case analysis and the coding  the output and input is same .So , I can say that my code is all right.
