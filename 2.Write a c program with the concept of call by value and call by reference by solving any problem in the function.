Problem No : 02
Problem Name : Write a c program with the concept of call by value and call by reference by solving any problem in the function.
Sample Input/Output :   Enter base and height : 6
7
Area using call by value = 21.000000
Area using call by Reference = 21.000000

Process returned 0 (0x0)   execution time : 1.596 s
Press any key to continue.
Coding :
#include<stdio.h>
double TriangleAreaByValue(double base  ,double height)
{
    return(.5*base*height);
}
void TriangleAreaByReference(double*base ,double*height,double*area)
{
    *area = (.5*(*base)*(*height));
}
int main()
{
    double base,height;
    double area_val,area_ref;

    printf("Enter base and height : ");
    scanf("%lf%lf",&base,&height);

    area_val=TriangleAreaByValue(base,height);
    printf("Area using call by value = %lf\n",area_val );
    TriangleAreaByReference(&base,&height,&area_ref);
    printf("Area using call by Reference = %lf\n",area_ref);
    return 0;
}
Result and Discussion : : From  the case analysis and the coding  the output and input is same .So , I can say that my code is correct.
