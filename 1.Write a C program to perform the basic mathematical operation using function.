Problem No:01
Problem Name:Write a C program to perform the basic mathematical operation using function.
Coding: #include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a, b, c, d, e, f;
    printf("Enter two numbers:");
    scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
    c=a+b;
    d=a-b;
    e=a/b;
    f=a*b;

    printf("summation of a and b is :%d\n",c);
    printf("substraction of a and b is :%d\n",d);
    printf("divition of a and b is :%d\n",e);
    printf("multiply of a and b is :%d\n",f);
    return 0;

}
Sample input/output: Enter two numbers:12
6
summation of a and b is :18
substraction of a and b is :6
divition of a and b is :2
multiply of a and b is :72

Process returned 0 (0x0)   execution time : 11.108 s
Press any key to continue.
Result and Discussion: From  the case analysis and the coding  the output and input is same .So , I can say that my code is all right.
